# Good-Samaritan
A private website made to efficiently track and manage Ridglea Christian Church community aid services such as bus passes, utility bill assistance, and emergency food bag distribution. Made with React, this application has features such as searchable, sortable, and filterable data entries, service history tracking, entry updating and deletion, and user authentication. This project allowed me to become more familiar with frontend development, state management, and data manipulation and persistence. Future development plans include connecting data entries to a cloud database, login information encryption, and importing data from files. Because this app was made for internal use only, the code will not be uploaded here. However, a showcase video is available to present the app's working featurea.
